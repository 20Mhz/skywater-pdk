.. Acronyms

.. glossary::

    sc
    Standard Cell
        The basic building blocks of digital circuit design.

    ce
        Memory Core

    DRC
    Design Rule Check
    Design Rule Checking
       Design rule checking or check(s) is the process of determing whether the
       physical layout of a particular chip layout satisfies a series of
       required parameters called design rules.

    LVS
    Layout Verse Schematic
       Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification is the process of determining
       whether a particular integrated circuit layout corresponds to the
       original :ref:`schematic` or :ref:`circuit diagram` of the design.

    PEX
    Parasitic Extraction
       Parasitic extraction is calculation of the parasitic effects in both the
       designed devices and the required wiring interconnects of an electronic
       circuit. This includes all parasitic components (often called parasitic
       devices) including parasitic;

        * capacitances,
        * resistances, and
        * inductances.

    NLDM
      Non-Linear Delay Model

    CCS
    ECSM
      Current Source Models


    CIF
    Caltech Intermediate Form
        From the 1990's, the CIF format has largely been replaced by the GDS
        format.
    MiM
    MIM
    MiM caps
        Stands for "metal-insulator-metal" and is a type of IC capacitor
        structure.

        These are capacitors that are made between two metal route layers,
        usually close to the top of the metal stack.

        Generally they are around 1fF/um^2, a lot better than MoM caps.

        The capacitance of MiM caps is on the top and bottom of the metal
        (while the capacitance of MoM caps is sidewall cap).

    MoM
    MoM caps
    VPP
    VPP capacitor
        Stands for "metal-oxide-metal" and is a type of IC capacitor structure.

        These are capacitors which are made by interleaving fingers of metal.

        Sometimes MoM caps are referred to as "VPP" capacitors (stands for
        "vertical parallel plate").

        The capacitance of MoM caps is capacitance of the metal sidewalls which
        is significantly lower than that provided MiM caps.
